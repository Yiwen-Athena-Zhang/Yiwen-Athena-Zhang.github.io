In biomedical research, AI algorithms can be used to reach diagnosis, predict disease progression and patients’ survival, recommend patients’ treatments and much more, which is all fascinating. But the question is: will these algorithms be ever applied in clinical practice and, in turn, improve people lives?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPsychobiology: looking at the bigger picture\n\n2020-11\nThe aim of the talk was to describe the potential of interdisciplinary research that crosses the boundaries of social and biological sciences, with a special focus on the field of psychobiology"

I am fully funded as the first cohort [Enlighten Scholar] (https://www.lse.ac.uk/study-at-lse/Graduate/fees-and-funding/enlighten-scholarship). Before joining LSE, I worked at the International Organization for Migration, analysing the UK National Referral Mechanism Data.\nMy research interests lie in the political economy of inequality, public opinion, social policy, and computational social science, with a global focus and a particular emphasis on the contexts of China and the UK. My current projects include: - Examine how welfare systems shape redistribution preferences across different countries - Explore how news narratives influence international attitudes - Replication of social experiments with synthetic data from LLMs\nAs a first-generation student from southwest China, I am passionate about public welfare and youth leadership. I’m the co-founder of an education project, “Future Youth (后浪计划)”, and have been recognized as a Forbes China 30 Under 30. I am also a World Economic Forum Global Shaper and serve part-time as curator of the Beijing Hub.
