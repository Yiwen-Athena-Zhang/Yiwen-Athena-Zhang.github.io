    "text": "I am a first-year MRes/PhD student in the Department of Government, affiliated with the Data Science Institute at the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE), under the supervision of Professor Valentino Larcinese. I am fully funded as the first cohort Enlighten Scholar. Before joining LSE, I worked at the International Organization for Migration, analysing the UK National Referral Mechanism Data.\nMy research interests lie in the political economy of inequality, public opinion, social policy, and computational social science, with a global focus and a particular emphasis on the contexts of China and the UK. My current projects include: - Examine how welfare systems shape redistribution preferences across different countries - Explore how news narratives influence international attitudes - Replication of social experiments with synthetic data from LLMs\nAs a first-generation student from southwest China, I am passionate about public welfare and youth leadership. I’m the co-founder of an education project, “Future Youth (后浪计划)”, and have been recognized as a Forbes China 30 Under 30. I am also a World Economic Forum Global Shaper and serve part-time as curator of the Beijing Hub. In my spare time, I enjoy playing football, watching musicals, and hiking.\n\nKey topics\n\nPolitical Economy of Inequality\nPolitical Psychology\nPublic Opinion\nSocial Policy\nComputational Social Science\n\n\n\nEducation\n\nMPhil Comparative Politics - Peking University\nBA Politics (Joint Honors Program in Politics, Law, and Sociology) - Peking University"
