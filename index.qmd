I am a first-year MRes/PhD student in the Department of Government, affiliated with the Data Science Institute at the <strong>London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE)</strong>, under the supervision of Professor [Valentino Larcinese](https://www.lse.ac.uk/people/valentino-larcinese). I am fully funded as the first cohort [Enlighten Scholar](https://www.lse.ac.uk/study-at-lse/Graduate/fees-and-funding/enlighten-scholarship). Before joining LSE, I worked at the International Organization for Migration, analysing the UK National Referral Mechanism Data.

My research interests lie in the <strong>political economy of inequality, public opinion, social policy, and computational social science</strong>, with a global focus and a particular emphasis on the contexts of China and the UK. My current projects include:
-	Examine how welfare systems shape redistribution preferences across different countries
-	Explore how news narratives influence international attitudes
-	Replication of social experiments with synthetic data from LLMs

As a first-generation student from southwest China, I am passionate about public welfare and youth leadership. I’m the co-founder of an education project, “Future Youth (后浪计划)”, and have been recognized as a Forbes China 30 Under 30. I am also a World Economic Forum Global Shaper and serve part-time as curator of the Beijing Hub. In my spare time, I enjoy playing football, watching musicals, and hiking.
